Known Bugs:

 - User becomes blue colour and AI doesn't initialise
	 - Seems to occur after the AI wins a game
	 - the game after this 'game' doesn't suffer the same problem
	 - the problem then occurs again after a proper game has occured

User Interface
 - it sucks
	- going to move the options on the right panel into a menu bar I think
	- add "are you sure?" messages for changing things
	- Give some indication of when changing the size takes effect
