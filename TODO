Known Bugs:
 - after a move that makes the game entirely their colour or white the next move is the wrong colour. 
	- e.g. after removing the AI's blues by rolling over, the next move that should be the AI's is taken by the player and is blue,
	- can't reproduce this problem now, not sure of cause

Fixed Bugs:
 - User becomes blue colour and AI doesn't initialise
	 - Seems to occur after the AI wins a game
	 - the game after this 'game' doesn't suffer the same problem
	 - the problem then occurs again after a proper game has occured
